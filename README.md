How to complie: use 'make' command to compile three files at a time \
		If you want to compile a specific file, please use 'make hw1a' \
		or 'make hw1b' or 'make microcat' command.

How to run: ./hw1a  ./hw1b will run hw1a.c and hw1b.c respectively, no \
		arguments required \
	    For microcat, please type in '>' (qutation marks required) to use\		    redirection sign. Also, type in '>>' to use the append sign, which \
	    won't overwrite existing files.

Limitation: Doesn't support multiple '>', and only support '>' filename. IN other words, if there're more than one file after redirection sign, the program will quit normally. Also, if there is a filename that is '>', the program will perceive it has redirection sign first.
